              is project that my partner and I have launched over theÂ past few
              weeks. It's a new platform to shed light on the other roles that
              exist in theÂ creative industryÂ that don't often get talked about.
              Weâ€™re collecting together resources, interviews and more to help
              young creatives navigate these different roles â€“ What are they?
              Who does them? And what does it take to get into them?

          Behind the scenes we have been conducting interviews with loads of
          brilliant people, gathering their stories and advice to help young
          people better understand the creative industries and find a role that suits them.
