              is project that my partner and I have launched over theÂ past few
              weeks. It's a new platform to shed light on the other roles that
              exist in theÂ creative industryÂ that don't often get talked about.
              Weâ€™re collecting together resources, interviews and more to help
              young creatives navigate these different roles â€“ What are they?
              Who does them? And what does it take to get into them?

          Behind the scenes we have been conducting interviews with loads of
          brilliant people, gathering their stories and advice to help young
          people better understand the creative industries and find a role that
          suits them.

          All the articles are organised into their own category based on the
          job role that is being talked about. The pieces are highlighted by a
          floating category sticker which is achieved using React state, data
          from Prismic and a custom hook.

          All of the content for the articles utilises Prismic's "slices" so we
          can conditionally render content based on what is required for the
          article.

          The hero section of the homepage maps over data from Prismic to create
          these fun stickers that can be dragged, thrown and (when we have
          enough content) can be used as a way to navigate the site to various
          articles and categories.
