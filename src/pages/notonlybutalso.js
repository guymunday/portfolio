              is project that my partner and I have launched over theÂ past few
              weeks. It's a new platform to shed light on the other roles that
              exist in theÂ creative industryÂ that don't often get talked about.
              Weâ€™re collecting together resources, interviews and more to help
              young creatives navigate these different roles â€“ What are they?
              Who does them? And what does it take to get into them?

          brilliant people, gathering their stories and advice to help young
          people better understand the creative industries and find a role that
          suits them.

          All of the content we are collecting will exist on a new site built
          with JAMstack technologies, namely Gatsby.js, Prismic CMS and Netlify.
          The current landing page is built on a custom WordPress theme with
          GSAP3 animations.
