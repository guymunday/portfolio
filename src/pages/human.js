              from industry-leaders designed to inspire action, commitment and
              bold ideas. For its latest issue it was redesigned and I built a
              new website with fun, interactive features to compliment the
              collage aesthetic.

          I had a lot of fun making promotional videos for social media and the
          launch party which was unfortunately postponed due to Covid-19
          lockdown.

          As this website was to compliment a physical magazine, I brought in
          interactive elements to make the website feel more tactile. The blocks
          of colours are randomised on load as is the logo to bring in the
          playful, collage aesthetic.
